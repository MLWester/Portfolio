# Space Explorer Mini Game

## Overview
The Space Explorer Mini Game is a 2D platformer where players control a space explorer navigating a series of platforms. The objective is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding falling asteroids. This project is built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, showcasing game mechanics, collision detection, and player controls.

## Features
- **Player Control**: Move the space explorer left, right, and jump between platforms.
- **Coin Collection**: Players earn points by collecting coins scattered across the platforms.
- **Hazards**: Asteroids randomly fall from above, challenging the player's reflexes.
- **2D Gameplay**: Simple yet engaging platformer mechanics.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when the player is hit by an asteroid.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core game logic and interactivity.
- **Browser-Based**: Runs directly in any modern web browser.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Use the following controls:
   - **Arrow Keys**: Move left and right.
   - **Spacebar**: Jump between platforms.
3. Avoid falling asteroids while collecting as many coins as possible.
4. The game ends when the player is hit by an asteroid.

## Game Mechanics
1. **Platform Physics**:
   - Platforms are stationary, and the player must navigate them using jumps.
2. **Coin Collection**:
   - Coins appear on random platforms and are collected upon collision with the player.
   - Each coin increases the player's score.
3. **Asteroid Hazards**:
   - Asteroids fall randomly from the top of the screen.
   - Collision with an asteroid ends the game.
4. **Score System**:
   - A running score tracks the number of coins collected.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Game mechanics implementation using JavaScript.
- Collision detection with coins, platforms, and asteroids.
- Basic animations and physics in a 2D game environment.
- Real-time user interaction and input handling.
