# Health Care Database Design for BSA Urgent Care

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive database design for **BSA Urgent Care**, addressing critical challenges in healthcare data management. The database aims to enhance data integrity, reduce redundancy, and promote interoperability among healthcare systems. The design adheres to regulatory standards while ensuring seamless data exchange and secure patient information management.

## Features
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Visual representation of the database structure, including relationships among entities.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Optimized database design to eliminate redundancy and ensure efficient data management.
- **SQL Implementation**: Structured tables and queries to manage healthcare data effectively.
- **Security and Privacy**: Implements robust data integrity and security measures, complying with HIPAA guidelines.
- **Healthcare Workflow Support**: Designed to support critical healthcare processes like patient registration, billing, and medical record management.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Design**: ERD and normalization techniques (3NF).
- **SQL**: Implementation of tables, relationships, and queries.
- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**: Database management for healthcare operations.

## How It Works
1. **Entities and Relationships**:
   - Key entities include Staff, Patients, Doctors, Nurses, Rooms, Medical Records, and Billing.
   - Relationships capture workflows such as patient registration, nurse assignments, doctor treatments, and billing processes.

2. **Normalization**:
   - The database is structured in 3NF to eliminate data redundancy and ensure efficient data retrieval.

3. **SQL Implementation**:
